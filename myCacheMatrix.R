# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching 
# the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. Below you can find a pair 
# of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

# This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
m <- NULL
set <- function(y) {
  x <<- y
  m <<- NULL
}
get <- function() x
setSolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
getSolve <- function() m
list(set = set, get = get,
     setSolve = setSolve,
     getSolve = getSolve)
}

# This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
# then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getSolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setSolve(m)
  m ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
